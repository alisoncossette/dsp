# Learn Statistics

Read Allen Downey's [Think Stats (second edition)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/) and [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/) for getting up to speed with core ideas in statistics and how to approach them programmatically. Both books are completely available online, or you can buy physical copies if you would like.

Some people enjoy video content such as Khan Academy's [Probability and Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability) or the much longer and more in-depth Harvard [Statistics 110](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo). You might also be interested in the book [Statistics Done Wrong](http://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/) or a very short [overview](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/the-math-you-need-to-start/) from School of Data.


Complete the following exercises. They come from Think Stats, and some can be solved using code provided with the book. The preface of Think Stats [explains](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2001.html#toc2) how to use the code.

Communicate the problem, how you solved it, and the solution, within each of the following [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files. (You can include code blocks and images within markdown.)

Elvis Presley had a twin brother who died at birth.  What is the probability that Elvis was an identical twin?
T=twins
F=fraternal
I=identical

P(Twins)=P(F)+P(I) = 1/125 + 1/300 = 17/1500


Utilize conditional probability to calculate the probability of him being identical given that we KNOW already he is a twin..
P(I|T) = P(I)/P(T) = (1/300)/(17/1500) = 5/17

How do frequentist and Bayesian statistics compare?

The prime difference relates to how they each use probability.  Bayes would start with a reaonsable probability distribution and then collect data, and updated the distribution whereas a frequentist would only use the data from sampling.
